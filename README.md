# Airbnb-Sentiment-Analysis
# Introduction 
Airbnb is a company that specializes in empowering small time property owners to rent their properties for short term and long term rentals (and generate a secondary source of income). On the Airbnb platform, users give these properties ratings and reviews  providing a wealth of information for both property managers and future tenants.
# Goal
Our goal was to build a model that predicts whether an Airbnb property in New York receives a “better than the competition” score or not by extracting attributes that are determined to be important, and performing a sentiment analysis on the reviews for existing properties. Our goal is primarily to make ratings more scientific, and precise, as well as help hosts understand more about the key factors that will influence their business and revenues; while at the same time giving an easy to understand metric on whether a new property will pass and receive a “good” score or fail and receive a “poor” score.
# Dataset 
We used datasets from the Airbnb website (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) to look for attributes which
are significant drivers for Airbnb property ratings. We will be using the following datasets:
1) Listings - which contains the detailed listing’s data for New York
2) Reviews - detailed customer review data for listings in New York.
